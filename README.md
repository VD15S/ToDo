# to_do_app
#Author: Vidhi Srivastava
This project is a Basic ToDo app made using Only Flutter.
I have used the basic concepts of Flutter to develop this App including Stateful Widgets, Classes, Function overloading, etc.
To store and retrieve the data , stack functionality is used over here.

This Project is primarily developed using 3 functions, that are:
1.main.dart : the main function for execution of all the functions
2.home.dart : the designing of Home screen is done here 
3.todoitems.dart :the main logic building of the app is done here and the designing of the To Do items is done here
4.todo.dart : data storage and retrieval is done here.
